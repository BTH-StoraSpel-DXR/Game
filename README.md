# Sail game engine :sailboat:

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/aqy3xsricje3cv28?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Piratkopia13/sail)

Sail is a small c++ game engine developed and maintained as a hobby project

Current features include
  - DirectX 11
  - Component based entity system
  - Event system
  - Deferred rendering
  - Hot reloadable shaders
  - .. and more

### Installation

Sail requires Visual Studio 2017.

I'm not even sure if everything required to build it is contained in this repo, hit me up if there are any issues.


### Future things I wanna implement

 - PBR
 - AI
 - RTX
 - Cross-platform support (dx11/12, opengl/vulkan)
